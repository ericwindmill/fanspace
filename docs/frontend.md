# Frontend
This single page app uses the React.js framework and Redux architecture.

## npm

## Webpack
Webpack is almost necessary to keep track and bundle all of the JS and JSX files used in the app. 

## Redux
The Redux cycle and library is implemented to organize and architect the frontend.

## Pure, sweet CSS (and some Sass variables)
All design is done with pure css, heavily relying on the future of layout: CSS Grid.

## Chart.js
Charts displayed in user profile are made using the React-Chart.js library. 

## Other Dependencies
*Redux Thunk for querying the database asyncronously.
*HTML Canvas (used by Chart.js library)
*Babel for transpiling JSX into JS.
