## Future Implementations

###Band Metrics / Information Page
Fans can see metrics from MMJ concerts through the years.

###Setlist Feeds
Fans can share memories of concerts by uploading videos and pictures to a feed on each setlist.

###Direct Messaging
Users should be able to communicate privately.

###Map-Based Metrics
Users should be able to see a map showing the cities that they've seen the artist. 

###Social Media Sharing
Fans should be able to share the metrics via all the popular social media sites!

###Fan Forum
A nice place for fans to trade records, sell tickets, and geek out!

###Trophies
Fans can earn trophies based on their metrics.

###More Artists!
Although this project was born out of a love for My Morning Jacket, I'd like to add other artists with loyal fanbases in the future. This is meant to be a fan club website, and not meant to cross metrics from multiple artists. In the future, it would essentially be a 'series' of fanclub apps.
