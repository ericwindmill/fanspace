      - interactiviry on profile page
      - album percentage charts
   * Styling Fix and Flare:
      - AOS Animate landing page screen
      - CSS list above.
    * you should ONLY be able able to explore shows by city, year, etc
      - main setlist index should be a feed of some sort (easiest would be a randomly generate 'featured')

  ### User Metrics
  * missing songs
  * covers (this will just be considered another album for now)
  * number of times seeing a song


  **Issues to remember: 
  Re-rendering the attends click button - by far the hardest thing I've done.
  Displaying the user profile in a reasonable way (chart JS)
