# Backend

## Ruby on Rails and Heroku
Fanspace runs on Ruby on Rails and is hosted at Heroku. The only purpose of the backend is to provide RESTful APIs and respond with JSON data. Because my backend needs were limited, the 'boilerplate' code made Ruby on Rails the perfect option for this app. 

## Database

PostgreSQL is required for Heroku.

## Bcrypt

BCrypt for password-salting and hashing.
