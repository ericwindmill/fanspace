#Fanspace
[Franspace](https://fanspaceapp.herokuapp.com/#/)

Fanspace.io is a web application that allows mega-fans of My Morning Jacket connect and track their concert metrics. Users get to 'digitially collect' concert experiences and compare them with other fans. Are you sure you're even a fan if you don't have the metrics to prove it?

Fanspace is a passion project made by Eric Windmill.

##Product Design
Fanspace.io was built from conception to MVP in 11 days.

A [proposal](https://github.com/ericwindmill/fanspace/blob/master/docs/proposal.md) was drafted in order to guide me in this process.

A [database schema](https://github.com/ericwindmill/fanspace/blob/master/docs/schema.md) was designed to help me plan out my app.
