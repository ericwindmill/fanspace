# Groovie HQ

[Groovie](https://fanspaceapp.herokuapp.com/#/) is a web application that allows mega-fans of My Morning Jacket connect and track their concert metrics. Users get to 'digitially collect' concert experiences and compare them with other fans. Are you sure you're even a fan if you don't have the metrics to prove it?

Groovie is a passion project made by Eric Windmill.

This app was built using Ruby on Rails, React.js Redux, amongst many other modern technolgies.

## Product Design
Groovie was built from conception to MVP in 11 days.

A [proposal](https://github.com/ericwindmill/fanspace/blob/master/docs/proposal.md) was drafted in order to guide me in this process.

A [database schema](https://github.com/ericwindmill/fanspace/blob/master/docs/schema.md) was designed to help me plan out my app.
